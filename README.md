# ComputerVision_Projects

Python & OpenCV projects : 

- Finger Count : detects the hand landmarks (fingers) then calculate how much fingers up.

- PC volume Controller : detects hand landmarks (fingers) then vitually control the volume of the pc by calculating the distance between the thumb and the index finger.

- ML Virtual painter :  detects hand landmarks (fingers) then vitually paint in real-time using camera in the air.

- ML Virtual Mouse : controlling the mouse movement using Python and openCV with real-time camera that detects hand landmarks.

- ML Trainer using OpenCV and Python : Pose estimation using MediaPipe lib + finding the points of the desired angles. Based on the angle we count number of reps of any gesture/exercice, e.g. biceps curls.
